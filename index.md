Hi. i'm LC23. you may know me from such hits as 'busting into your
twitter thread asking absolutely moronic questions' and 'defending
disgusting bullshit from first principles on the tl'. today, we're 
here to discuss why you should not date me.

i snort when i laugh sometimes. i have an abhorent pile of vices.
i enjoy sexual deviance. i have droll blueish politics. i'm an unapologetic
wagie and i'm mostly fine with that. i'm a 7 out of 10 in golden hour light
if i've shaved recently and you like androgyny. i'm less than 6 foot but still
a top. i'll probably want you to do stupid shit like 'smoke weed on a hill'
as a date bc spending money is overrated. i'm 'pan poly and partnered', but,
not the cool kind with a nesting partner. i'm a parent and my kid will always
come before you. my job will also often come before you, bc it supports my 
kid.

you're some twitter random. you don't know anything about me. i have no 
reason to differentiate you from anyone else on here. you don't live near
my undisclosed location. you still think you can find The One. you have
mid taste in music. you dance in a societally prescribed way rather than
from the gut. you're susceptible to trends like 'browsing date me pages'.

<details><summary> dating as an abstraction is kinda shit </summary>
<!-- reminder comment -->
if you want to hang out, but keep sex on the table, just say that. if you 
need to build a life with someone, i'm probably not the one unless you're 
tryna build a really weird life and only base a small part of it on your 
'other'. beyond that, dating is just an attempt to force structure and markets
onto 'people meeting people'. if you wanna fall for someone over the internet,
they don't need to roll out the red carpet for you. you can just do that.

this whole date me page thing is cute when a few people do it, and stems from
people saying 'twitter' when asked 'what dating apps do you use'. but, twitter
dating was never predicated on format. quite the contrary, it was usually an 
emergent property of two (or more) wierdos being -so fucking wierd- at each
other online that there was little option but for them to date. if you feel 
like that about someone's profile, tell them, you fucking pussy. if not, don't 
force it. it carves out all the grace of the thing.

no one is, online. this account is as naked as i know how to anonymously be 
but it's still far from who i am. this date me page, were i to take it 
seriously, would be even further from who i am.

if you insist on trying to know if we should be intimate via the internet,
you're gonna have to go harder than this. listen to some streams. reply guy.
dm if you're brave (discord in bio, i think, if that's preferable). i'm not
hard to reach, and probably flattered by your (genuine) interest.

but pandering for it feels bad, so, here's this thing.
